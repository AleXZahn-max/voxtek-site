## 📡 OVERVIEW

**VoxTek System** is a complex web application simulating the interface of **Vox (The TV Demon)**. It serves as a dashboard for "citizens" to interact, consume media, and be monitored. Behind the glitchy, cyberpunk UI lies a robust backend powered by **Firebase** (Firestore, Auth, Storage).

### ⚡ KEY FEATURES
